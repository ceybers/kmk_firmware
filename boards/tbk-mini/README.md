# TBK Mini

A split keyboard with a 3x6 columnar stagger and 3 thumb keys, created by Quentin LEBASTARD of [Bastard Keyboards](https://bastardkb.com/).

This configuration is for my personal handwired build, using a pair of Raspberry Pi Pico instead of Elite-C MCUs. The row/col pinout will most likely not match with yours!

The default keymap is a simple barebones Colemak DH without any numbers, for testing purposes.
